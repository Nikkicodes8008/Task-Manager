📝 Nikhil's Task Manager (First Python GUI Project)
This is a simple yet fully functional Task Manager built using Python's Tkinter library.
It allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with all tasks being saved automatically into a task.json file for persistence.

✨ Key Features:

Add new tasks easily through the input box.

Delete tasks with a single click.

Mark tasks as completed — completed tasks get a ✓ checkmark.

Scrollable task list with a clean dark mode theme.

Tasks are saved to a JSON file, so they remain even after closing the app.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python 3

Tkinter (for GUI)

JSON (for saving data)

pathlib (for safe file handling)

💬 About the Project: This is my first-ever GUI application in my Python journey.
I wanted to learn how to create interactive windows, manage layouts, and handle real-world file operations — and building a Task Manager felt like the perfect start!

🎯 What's Special:

Clean, structured code

Practical and beginner-friendly

🚀 I'm excited to keep improving and building bigger projects in the future.
Thank you for checking out my work! ❤️
